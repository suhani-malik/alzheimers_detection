WHAT WE NEED TO STUDY : 
1. Feature Extraction Techniques
2. Feature Selection
3. Classification Algorithms
4. Ensemble Learning
5. K fold cross validation

SIMPLIFIED WORKFLOW:
1. Look into feature engineering because our data is imbalanced
2. Perform feature Selection
3. Create the model (Use Ensemble Learning) by first splitting the data using K fold cross validation technique.
4. Evaluate the model (i.e. performance metrics)
5. Optimization (see if there's any hyperparameters we can tune)
